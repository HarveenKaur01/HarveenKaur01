# Hi there, I'm Harveen! 🚀
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
As an aerospace engineering enthusiast, I’m always diving into literal rocket science—because when your work involves pushing the boundaries of flight, gravity just becomes a suggestion..

## ✈️ What I Work On
3D Simulation: Currently developing a radial engine assembly simulation.
Aerospace Engineering: Passionate about propulsion, aerodynamics, and structural analysis.
Web Development: Building a website to showcase my projects and research.
